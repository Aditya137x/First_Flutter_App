# Dice App

Its my first app build with Flutter. You can try things out by installing the apk files from [Releases](https://github.com/Aditya137x/First_Flutter_App/releases)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:
